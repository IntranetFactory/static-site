Static Site Generator based on
- [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) - an extremely simple, pluggable static site generator
- [Gulp v4](http://gulpjs.com/) - the streaming build system
For those well acquainted with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), folder structure and naming convention of posts will be familiar. 

## Features
This site generator includes the following features:
- [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) - time-saving synchronised browser testing (once you go live-reload, you'll never come back)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers
- [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) - a tool for transforming styles with JS plugins
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) - adding vendor prefixes by the rules of [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/)
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) - the pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX (with preconfigured ruleset by [Google](https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google))
- [Liquid](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid) - an awesome, Django/Jinja-like template engine for node.js (similar to Jekyll's [Liquid](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/))
